2. Generate new service called my-service
3. Import the new-cmp and my-service into app.module.ts
4. Import newly created service on app.component.ts (see video)
5. Display {{using interpolation}} the imported service (data) into the app.component.html
6. Reuse the service to new-cmp.component.ts and display to new-cmp.component.html
